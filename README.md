# VeRi Image-Based Vehicle Re-Identification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on **Vehicle Re-Identification (ReID)** using the **VeRi dataset**. The goal is to apply deep learning techniques to identify and match vehicle images from non-overlapping camera views. This Jupyter Notebook is designed to guide you through setting up a GPU-accelerated environment on Google Colab, preparing the codebase, and running the required steps for model training and evaluation.

## Prerequisites

1. **Google Colab** account with GPU access.
2. **Google Drive** for saving and loading files.
3. **Git** repository access containing the project codebase.
4. Basic understanding of deep learning concepts and Python programming.

## Project Structure

1. **Step 1: GPU Selection**
   - Ensure you are using a GPU for accelerated computing by selecting the appropriate hardware in Google Colab.
   
   ```markdown
   Edit -> Notebook Settings -> Hardware Accelerator -> GPU
   ```

2. **Step 2: Google Drive Setup**
   - Mount your Google Drive to Colab for accessing datasets and saving results.

   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```

3. **Step 3: Clone Git Repository**
   - Clone the GitHub repository containing the code for training and testing the model.
   
   ```bash
   !git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
   ```

4. **Step 4: Data Preprocessing**
   - Prepare the VeRi dataset by loading and preprocessing the images into the required format for training the model.
   
   ```python
   # Code snippet to load and preprocess the data
   ```

5. **Step 5: Model Training**
   - Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the VeRi dataset. You can customize the training process by adjusting hyperparameters and layers as needed.

   ```python
   # Example training script
   ```

6. **Step 6: Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the trained model using predefined metrics to measure accuracy and precision in vehicle identification.

   ```python
   # Code snippet to evaluate the model
   ```

7. **Step 7: Saving and Exporting Results**
   - Save the trained model and evaluation results to Google Drive for future use.

   ```python
   # Example of saving model to Google Drive
   ```

## How to Run

1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**.
2. Follow the steps in order, starting with **Step 1: GPU Selection**.
3. Ensure that your Google Drive is mounted, and clone the codebase from the provided GitHub repository.
4. Run the data preprocessing, training, and evaluation cells.
5. Save the trained model and results to your Google Drive.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on the deep learning framework used in the project)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab-specific libraries (e.g., `google.colab` for mounting Drive)

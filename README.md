VeRi Image-Based Vehicle Re-Identification Project
Overview
This project focuses on Vehicle Re-Identification (ReID) using the VeRi dataset. The goal is to apply deep learning techniques to identify and match vehicle images from non-overlapping camera views. This Jupyter Notebook is designed to guide you through setting up a GPU-accelerated environment on Google Colab, preparing the codebase, and running the required steps for model training and evaluation.

Prerequisites
Google Colab account with GPU access.
Google Drive for saving and loading files.
Git repository access containing the project codebase.
Basic understanding of deep learning concepts and Python programming.
Project Structure
Step 1: GPU Selection

Ensure you are using a GPU for accelerated computing by selecting the appropriate hardware in Google Colab.
markdown
Copy code
Edit -> Notebook Settings -> Hardware Accelerator -> GPU
Step 2: Google Drive Setup

Mount your Google Drive to Colab for accessing datasets and saving results.
python
Copy code
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
Step 3: Clone Git Repository

Clone the GitHub repository containing the code for training and testing the model.
bash
Copy code
!git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
Step 4: Data Preprocessing

Prepare the VeRi dataset by loading and preprocessing the images into the required format for training the model.
